The thirty-seventh exercise of python was some "simple" review. I was given a HUGE list of symbols and I had to just review what they ment. Although, I have to admit, this was semi tedious and I had actually never encountered most of these symbols; which was somewhat of a problem. I had to look up what symbols I didn't know and a few of them didn't come up in the search results, and that was also a warning from Zed, he stated that I wouldn't be able to find some of them. But, I kept on trying anyways. This was decent review just reminding me as to what SOME symbols and commands do.
