Exercise 28: In exercise 28, I worked on Boolean Practice! This exercise put my memory to the test! I needed to remember whether all the terms were true or false. So, the first thing I had to do was take somewhat of a test. I had to right down all of the truth terms and give the correct answers. Then I had to check those answers in python by simply typing in one of the truth terms. Amazingly, I got every answer right! Thanks to my memory and my ability to pick up on the patterns. The study drills had me go farther into Boolean, and I had to find lots of "equality operators". The funny thing was, was that I already knew about most of them, but I didn't know that they were "equality operators". Overall this was a great exercise, and I would give it a 3-10 on the difficulty level, and a 7-10 on the funness factor!
