Exercise 19: In exercise 19, I worked on functions and variables. Did you notice that the variables in my function are not connected to the variables in my script. Also, I learned that "def" helps define your function(s). This exercise shows all the different ways I'm able to give our function "cheese_and_crackers" the values it needs to print them. I can give it straight numbers, variables, math, and even combine math and variables. I learned a great deal from this exercise! I can't wait to keep programming.
