Exercise 1: This paragraph will contain my thoughts on the first exercise of Python. So, in exercise 1, I worked on the very basics of programming, such as opening a file made in my text editor. I believe that Zed (the author of Python) had me do those things so that I could get used to easily being able to open files in Python. Overall, what I learned in Python mightâ€™ve seemed simple but, the technique will come in handy in the future.
