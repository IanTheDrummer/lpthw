So, in exercise 2, I worked on writing comments and pound symbols. I liked the fact that a pound symbol made the specific line of text invulnerable to any and all commands. I also learned comments can be used to tell you what something specifically does. Comments can also disable parts of a program temporarily. Yet again Iâ€™m asked to complete another simple lesson that will greatly help me on my journey to become a programmer!
