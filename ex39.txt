In exercise thirty-nine, I worked on doing things to lists, and this included: joining them, adding things to them, and appending them. I also, sort of learned what the append function does. Zed gave a rather confusing explanation on it's meaning. I still don't quite grasp what append does. I also had to use a new command/symbol, "len", and Zed didn't give me an explanation as to what on earth that does. This was a frustrating exercise only because I didn't understand a solid portion of it. Hopefully, the next exercise will make more sense.
