In exercise 39 I learned about dictionaries! Now, I learned that dictionaries are like lists in that you can pull seprate things out of out of them. The difference is that dictionaries let you pull elements out with anything, and it doesn't have to be numbers (like in lists). Dicts are smart enough to associate one thing to another! You can also put things into dicts with strings! However, it doesn't actually have to be a string, you can just do this, stuff[1] = "WOW". This is another essential piece of knowledge that I'm happy I've learned!
