The thirty-fifth exercise of Python had me working on Branches and functions. I had forgotten what functions did, and this definetly refreshed my memory! As far as "branches" go, Zed actually didn't talk about them or mention what they did. On that note, I've learned nothing about branches!!! Hopefully, he later talks about what they do and all that. As far as difficulty level goes, this was pretty simple to write and copy down. I eventually understood what everything did with a little help from the book. Overall, this was a fun exercise!
