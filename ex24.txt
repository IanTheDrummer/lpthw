In exercise 24 I practiced a good amount of things I already know, such as: Printing, Variables, Functions, Defining, Math, Escapes. There's also a neat little poem thats riddled full of escapes. Using the escapes was fun, but it sort of messed up the overall format and word placement of the poem (in my opinion). I think that this review was needed. It felt good to have all of this information refreshed in my brain. Overall, it was just another great and helpful exercise!
