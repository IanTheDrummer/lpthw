Exercise 32: In exercise 32, I worked with Loops and Lists. I have to say that I really liked lists and how useful the were! I didn't realize that they were used to store things. With the loops however, I found them very useful as well. I learned that they essentially run lists and repeatedly. I wonder if you could use them for looping things other than lists? Also, I wonder if you can store an infinite amount of things within a list... hmmm. Anyways, this was a fun exercise and I can't wait to complete more! :)
