In the 47th exercise of python I worked on Automated testing. Now,
I really still don't have a solid grip on this so cut me some slack.
For this exercise I had to use "nose" to test some random and simple
scripts brought to me by Zed. I also learned how to import "nose". If
one wanted to do so, they would simply have to type 'from nose.tools import *'.
Also, I learned that in order for nose to test something the name of thing being
tested has to have the word test in it. For instance Blah_test.py would work where
as Blah.py wouldn't. You would also need to rename what ever your testing within
the given module to test_blahblah() in order for nose to know what to test.
Overall, testing was a cool experience and I can't wait to do some more!
