Exercise 4: Variables and math were the main topics in the 4th lesson of Python. I learned that a variable in programming is nothing more than a name for something so you can use the name rather than the something as you code. Variables were a HUGE help when it came to writing MASSIVE segments of code. I also reviewed some of the math subjects that I focused on it exercise 3. All in all, I’m amazed at how much I’ve learned from one little book.
