Exercise 8: In exercise 8, I worked on more and more printing. This exercise was a repeat of the 7th exercise. The study drills were amazingly easy. I did use lots and lots of formatters in this exercise. Again, I have nothing special to say about this exercise, hopefully, the upcoming exercises will be more of a challenge.
