Exercise 5: Amazingly, in lesson 5, I still continue to work with even more variables and printing! I learned how to make a double string and that every time that you put double quotes around a piece of text, that you have made a string. As far as the variables portion of the exercise goes, I just focused on inserting variables into my strings. Just like how the variables keep coming, I keep learning!
