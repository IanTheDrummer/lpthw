Exercise 31: In exercise 31, I made a little bit of a game. So, you start out with a prompt saying "You are in a room with two doors. Do you go through door #1 or #2?" From here, the user gets to choose freely. Now, this is when the if statements came in hand, otherwise, I would just have you go through both doors eventually. But, that's not as fun as getting to choose something when the pressure is really high! As you will notice, I used LOTS and LOTS of if statements and else statements and elif statements. I didn't really know how useful they could be till now. Overall this was a fun exercise!
