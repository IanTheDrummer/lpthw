Exercise 21: In exercise 21, I used and talked about alot of math. I did also define the functions used in this exercise. When it came to math, I used the 4 main operations: addition, subtraction, multiplacion, division. There is a strange little puzzle at the end of the script too. There are two arguments in the script as well, a and b. I also returned a and b after I added them and divided them etc. This was a funky exercise and I'm still trudging on the next exercises.
