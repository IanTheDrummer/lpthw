In the forty-second exercise of Python, I worked on speaking OOP, or more commonly known as Object-Oriented.
The name is really straight forward seeing that you work a whole lot with "objects" and "classes".
Anyways, I had to start out with some word drills. I simply had to try my best to remember what some specific words
and commands meant. This wasn't much of a challenge because I already knew a few of the definitions. Next, I worked on
phase drills. The instructions on those phase drills, I found, were slightly confusing. From what I could figure out, I
had to be able to read some lines of code and English. The challenge was that these sentences were both made of English
and code! Crazy right? And to finish all of that up, I did a "little" bit of coding. Overall this was a good learning exercise
with a few key points.
