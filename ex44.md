In the 44th exercise, I worked on inheritance and composition.
I learned that inheritance is when one class gets it's features
from a parent class, which would make the two very similar. NOW,
the cool thing is that you can rewrite the subclass or child class
to only inherit certain things from the parent class. You can even
rewrite the parent class within the subclass! I personally think
that inheritance is SUPER COOL! Zed however told me that inheritance
is a rather bad thing and that it should be avoided. I think that is
a bunch of junk because inheritance is really awesome and helpful.
Well, there is my view on inheritance and also there's what I learned
in exercise 44.
