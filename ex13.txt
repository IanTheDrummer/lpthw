Exercise 13: So, in exercise 13 I worked on parameters, unpacking, and variables. When you open up the file, make sure you put any three pieces of text after you type in "python ex13.py", because I put 3 arguments in the code. I really like the new inupt method I used to pass variables! I learned that "argv" holds the arguments I pass to my python script when I run it. If you didn't already know, line 3 unpacks argv so that, rather than holding all the arguments, it gets assigned to four variables you can work with. This was a great lesson that I learned alot from! Can't wait to keep programming!
