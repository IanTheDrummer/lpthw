In the 45th exercise of Python I worked on making my own game. I started
off my first creating the structure of my game and adding a few things
that I know would come in handy in the future. The game itself was
about you yourself being stuck in a dark corridor and then escaping.
The plot at first was very vague but then was improved as time went on.
As far as making my game with an OOP mindset went... it was very challenging
at first. I struggled with classes and other things but I then eventually
sort of got the hang of it. Overall I loved making this game and hope I'll
get to make another one in the future!
