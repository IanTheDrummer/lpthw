In exercise 30, Zed introduced yet another mind blowing concept... the else and elif statements! DUN DUN DUUUUUUUUUN! These little critters are somewhat of a backup to the if statement. The else statement says that if the if statement isn't true, that to try this! Where as the elif statment is giving and else statement but in the form of an if statement. Confusing at first? YES! VERY CONFUSING!!! But I eventually got the hang of it. I yet again used if statements in my script and obviously used else and elif statements. I completed the study drills with ease as well. This was just another great exercise!
