In the forty-second exercise of Python, I worked on some new commands and other things. This exercise taught me about
"is-a" and "has-a" and I also learned a small portion more about objects and classes. First, I'll start by talking about is-a.
Is-a is a phrase to say that something inherits from another, sort of like "Steven is-a human". Then you have the magical "has-a",
and has-a is a phrase to say that something is composed of other things or has a trait, as in "Steven has a hand". After absorbing all
of that in, I had to use that knowledge in the field... or other wise known as my "TEXT EDITOR"... *cue dramatic music*. Zed gave me some
code to copy down, but that wasn't all. I had to write a comment over every class and object stating whether the string represented has-a or is-a.
Overall, this was an interesting exercise that was full of cool new programming tools!
