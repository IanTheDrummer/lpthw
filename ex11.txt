Exercise 11: So, exercise 11 had me finally focus on something other than printing! Exercise 11 was about asking questions. Now when I say asking questions I mean typing in code that ends in a question mark and using raw input to answer the question. It's really not that complicated! I also used "r" as my variable. I also found out that raw input presents a prompt to myself, gets input from myself and returns the input from me in a string. Overall, this was an interesting exercise. Can't wait to keep programming!
