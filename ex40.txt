In exercise 40, I learned about classes, objects, and modules! These were all very interesting subjects! I certainly love modules! Classes are still a bit of blur in the knowledge scope but I'm sure I'll get the hang of them! Anyways, I learned that a module is a python file with some stuff inside of it. Whilst coding, you would then import it by saying something along the lines of import stuff, and then you can use specific elements of it later on by saying something like stuff.dude(). You can also print variables that are included inside of your imported python file. What I know about classes is that their like blueprints for creating new mini-modules. And in some ways, a class is like a module as well. An object is what you get when you instantiate a class, and the best part is that you can then call that object like a function! Overall, this was a great exercise!
