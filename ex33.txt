In exercise 33 I worked on while-loops! Now, I learned that while-loops are similar to if statements. A while-loop says to run the indented text as long as it's true in the program. Where as an if statement is only read by python once and will be completely ignored after words if it's true or not. This particular loop is facinating but tricky to work with at first. When I say tricky I'm talking about trying to stop it from repeating itself forever and ever and ever and... Anyways, this was a fun exercise and I learned alot of great things!
