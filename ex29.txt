In exercise 29, Zed introduced an earth shattering concept... THE IF STATEMENT!!! *dramatic music* I had never worked with these before and eventually ended up loving them! It makes programming so much eaiser! Instead of having to type like 5 lines of script saying do this if it's true you can just use 2 lines with the if statement! Understanding what it does was very easy to learn as well. I figured out that it basically says that if said variable is true, to then run the indented script beneath it! This was just a really fun exercise! Then, Zed went even crazier and introduced... +=, and might I say this was great as well. The += symbol is basically saying: X = X + Y. And I got to use it in my script! I loved this exercise so very much!
