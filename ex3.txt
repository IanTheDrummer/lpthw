Exercise 3: The third exercise of Python had me focus on numbers and math. I learned about different math symbols and their meanings. This lesson was a nice refresher on math symbols. I also practiced using math in my script. I loved how my terminal program automatically solved my math equations for me. Overall, the lesson was a good review and definitely helped me in the ways of using math in programming!
