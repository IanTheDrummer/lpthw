Exercise 9: In exercise 9, I worked on an even bigger amount of printing. I had my code talk about the months of the years the days and other things. I also work with double-quotes again. The study drill wasn't much of a "drill", all I had to do was check my work. Overall, this was just another printing exercise that yet again helped strenghthen me in the way of coding.
