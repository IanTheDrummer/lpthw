First off, I want to start by saying that exercise thirty-six was by far my favorite exercise ever! I got to finally put my skills and imagination to work in programming. Infact, there were no rules or "guidelines", only me and my thoughts... and python and notepad++, BUT THATS BESIDES THE POINT! I loved this exercise truly because of the freedom it gave me, and freedom is hard to come by these days... *cough* THANKS OBAMA *cough*. Anyways, you'll notice that I used lots and lots and lots of functions. I used them because there very straight forward and well, really, that's what I know how to do so far with the information provided in the book. Are there other ways of going about making this game? Well yes, but I just love functions. Maybe, a little too much. Their so cute with their little parentheses and colons and... sorry... I started to trail off there. Designing the game was rather easy: I started out by drawing a list/map of the rooms that the player would go through. Then I exicuted that plan into my text editor. I think that the game came out splended; at least with my skill set. Overall, this was the most fun and semi-tedious exercise of all!
