In exercise 25 I did even more practice! I mainly worked on using fuctions, and defining them! I used a cool function that automatically breaks up words! Also, your going to import this exercise in python instead of typing "python ex25.py". Zed specifically told me to do so. There is some user input required whilst after importation. To be exact, I had to use 7 functions, now that may not seem like alot to you but that's the most I've ever used in my life! This was a good exercise and improved my skill in using functions!
