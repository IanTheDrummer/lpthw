Exercise 6:  The 6th exercise had me focus on strings and text. The “level of difficulty” had been increased in this exercise. I wrote more elaborate and advanced strings in this exercise. I also learned that a string is usually a bit of text you want to display to someone or “export” out of the program you are writing. Zed Shaw was smart in having me work on more advanced strings because my knowledge of basic string writing had already been “maxed out”. Overall this was a rather boring lesson but in the end, it turned out to be helpful!
