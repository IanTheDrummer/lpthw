In this exercise, I worked on accessing elements of lists. I learned how to view specific elements of lists, which I had actually been wanting to do ever since I heard of lists. One of the problems I found out that I'd run into was that telling python to grab a specific part of a list wasn't as easy as it sounds. Another thing that also made it difficult was having to count from zero. I never do that in real life but, apperently you have to do it in programming. Knowing this fact did help me slightly though! My goal for this exercise was to correctly name animals placed in an order. It might sound weird but it was fun and challenging! Overall I enjoyed this exercise!
