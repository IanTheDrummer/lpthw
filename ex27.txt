Exercise 27: Logic... that was the main focus of the twenty seventh exercise. I learned that in python we use the terms characters and phrases to decided whether something is true or false. Also, I learned that Logic is about finding out if the characters and other things are true at any point in the program! One thing I had to do was right down all of the Truth Terms on flash cards and memorize them in one week or at least till I was able to decipher whether 1 != 0 is true or not (and it is). In order to memorize them, I first looked at the terms and looked at if they were true or false, then at the end of the day I tested my self on them. I continued to do this for a week and I progressively got better and better! Something I didn't notice at first was that there are patterns in the terms. I slowly came to recognize the patterns and that's one of the reasons I now know the terms so well! Was this tedious? Yes, but, was it fun? YES! I strongly enjoyed this exercise and can't wait to do future ones!
