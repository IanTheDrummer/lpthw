In exercise 36 I worked on creating a project skeleton. So, Zed
led me through the steps of making a small project skeleton that
included a few different folders and some basic setup scripts and such.
I'm pleased that I have this nice template to use now or refer to
in the future. But, before any of the project skeleton stuff happened...
I had to install packages. Zed gave me four different links and told
me to figure out how the heck to install packages on my own. I also
found out that doing something like that is known as "yak shaving".
Essentially, "yak shaving" is when your doing something very tedious
and boring that just frankly takes FOREVER. At first, I did struggle
with figuring out how to install packages and before I even could do
so I had to download Pip. Now, Pip is a handy little doodad that helps
you install packages for python. Doing it manually would take FOREVER.
Eventually, I figured out how to install packages thanks to an
anonymous source... ;) But in the end I was pleased with my new packages:
Nose, Virtualenv, Distribute, and yes... pip!
