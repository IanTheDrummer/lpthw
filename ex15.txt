Exercise 15: In exercise 15, I worked on reading files! Yet again, I used agruments. This exercise involved writing 2 files. One being my ex15.py file, and the other file isn't a script but a plain text file that I had to try and read. To run the ex15.py file, you have to type,"python ex15.py," then after that you will need to include the name of a plain text file that you want to be able to read. Overall, this was a fun exercise that helped me in the way of "Reading Files"!
