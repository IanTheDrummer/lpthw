Exercise 16: In exercise 16, I worked on reading files yet again, but with a twist... I also wrote files in python! There are still arguments in the script. I have my script start out by asking you if you want to erase the file you used as an argument. The script gives you an option to either erase the file forever, or keep it. I wrote the script to that you would have to use raw_input to perform all of the tasks given to you by the script. Now, as far as writing a file in python goes, if the user decided to delete the file, I would have the user type 3 lines. Then immediately after the user typed the 3 lines, the script woudld save the 3 lines to the "deleted" file. I loved this exercise and the complexity of it!
