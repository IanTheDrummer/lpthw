Exercise 22: This was a very strange and interesting exercise. I didn't acctually have to do any coding. This was the biggest review exercise so far. It took me over 2 days to complete. At first I stuggeled and was confused but then, my mind recooperated and I was able to complete the exercise. In this exercise I had to go back and look at all of my exercises and write down all of the symbols I used and write their definitions. I also had to do the same thing with all of the keywords from all of my exercise previous to the one I'm talking about. Overall this was a HUGE exercise and I'm glad that their were NO STUDY DRILLS.
